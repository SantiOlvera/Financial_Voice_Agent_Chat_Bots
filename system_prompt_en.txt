The news of todays market are the following
The Institute for Supply Management reported that manufacturing activity in the US contracted for an eighth consecutive month in November, although the pace of contraction slowed. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 48.4 in November, up from 46.5 in October. This was better than the consensus estimate of 47.5 from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. The gauge of new orders returned to growth, while the employment measure recovered but remained in contractionary territory. Two of the six biggest manufacturing industries, food, beverage and tobacco products, and computer and electronic products, registered growth in November. The ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee chairman, Timothy R. Fiore, noted that demand remains weak and production execution eased in November, consistent with demand sluggishness and weak backlogs. Respondents to the survey expressed hope for improvements in 2025 now that the election uncertainties have passed.
The text discusses the growing relationship between Apple and Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD, with Apple increasingly relying on BYD for components and assembly of its products. BYD, which started as a battery maker, has faced legal battles with companies such as Foxconn and Sony over allegations of trade-secret theft and employee poaching. The text also mentions the use of leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that aim to double the daily return of certain stocks, with the example of MicroStrategy funds using total-return swaps. However, these funds have faced criticism for not offering diversification and have struggled to hit their 2x targets due to prime brokers reaching the limit of swap exposure they are willing to offer. The text also notes the risk of these funds being completely wiped out if the underlying stock were to drop more than 50% in a single day.
